### Hi there!
I'm kittte. I'm an artist and developer in the blockchain space. Historically, I've been avidly against all things related to cryptocurrency, but I never knew much about it. Then I learned about blockchain. It was love at first Merkle Patricia Trie.


My main focus is developing on EVM compatible blockchains and I'm also familiar with Hyperledger Fabric. I'm particularly interested in enterprise adoption of blockchain technology, especially for supply chain management.

- I’m currently working on releasing my first NFT collection
- I’m currently learning Solidity and Golang
- I’m looking to collaborate on interesting DeFi or NFT projects on EVM compatible blockchains
- I’m looking to grow my network and find a mentor
- Ask me about my strange career path that lead me here
- DM me on Twitter: \_kittte
